okay, for my new ashnet feature ashdrop:
    file transfer protocol

    0:
        sender broadcasts file in chunks of n bytes
        each chunk is prepended by 8 bytes - index|totalbytes
    1:
        receivers see a message on the msgid of ashdrop
        they either start recording or don't
        receivers store each chunk in memory 

notes:
    users will specify an ashdrop_dir for files to appear in
    users will specify their file acceptance settings - accept all, all under a certain size, etc
    these are all specified with aruments to the ashdrop daemon

possible improvements:
    sequential chunks should be written to disk when possible
