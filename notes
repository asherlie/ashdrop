okay, for my new ashnet feature ashdrop:
    file transfer protocol

    0:
        sender broadcasts file in chunks of n bytes
        each chunk is prepended by 8 bytes - index|totalbytes/totalchunks
        probably makes more sense to have it in terms of bytes
    1:
        receivers see a message on the msgid of ashdrop
        they either start recording or ignore altogether, stop reading for ignore case
        receivers allocate memory for totalbytes bytes and insert each 
        receivers store each chunk in memory as they receive them (see note for improvement)
    

notes:
    users will specify an ashdrop_dir for files to appear in
    users will specify their file acceptance settings - accept all, all under a certain size, etc
    these are all specified with aruments to the ashdrop daemon

possible improvements:
    sequential chunks should be written to disk when possible
